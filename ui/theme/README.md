Developing
==========

Java JDK 8 is required. Java 9 seems to bug out.

To start the development component library, run the following from
the project root:

    ./gradlew themeDevMode


In order to enable live updating of the CSS, run the following
from the project root while the dev server above is running:

    ./gradlew ui:theme:gulp_watch
